        <ul>
            <li><strong>1985</strong> - Born in Madeira</li><br>
            <li><strong>1992–2002</strong> - Youth Career at Andorinha,Nacional,Sporting CP from 1995 to 2002.At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[25] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team, and the first team, all within a single season.[19] A year later, on 7 October 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, against Moreirense, and scored two goals in their 3–0 win.[26] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[27] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing the winger, met with him at Arsenal's grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer.</li><br>
            <li><strong>2003-2009</strong> - Ronaldo became Manchester United's first-ever Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season.[32] His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[33] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[34] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[35] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager, Alex Ferguson, of whom he later said, "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.</li><br>
            <li><strong>2009-2018</strong> - Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of £80 million (€94 million). His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.[108] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[109] Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7, the number Ronaldo wore at Manchester United. Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[110] which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.<br>Ronaldo made his debut in La Liga on 29 August 2009, against Deportivo La Coruña, and scored from the penalty spot in Madrid's 3–2 home win.[112] He scored in each of his first four league fixtures with the club, the first Madrid player to do so.[113] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[114] His strong start to the season, however, was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[115][116] A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería.[117] Midway through the season, Ronaldo placed second in the running for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, behind Lionel Messi of Barcelona, Madrid's historic rivals. He finished the campaign with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in the Spanish competition.[118][119] His first season at Real Madrid ended trophyless.</li><br>
            <li><strong>2018-2020</strong> - On 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer, which included an additional €12 million in other fees,[231] and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs. The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old,[232] and the highest ever paid by an Italian club.[233] Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Real Madrid,[234] but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.<br>On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his first goals for Juventus in his fourth appearance for the club in a 2–1 home win over Sassuolo. His second was the 400th league goal of his career.[236] On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juventus, he was sent off in the 29th minute for "violent conduct"—the first time in 154 Champions League appearances.[237] Ronaldo became the first player in history to win 100 Champions League matches, setting up Mario Mandžukić's winner in a 1–0 home victory over Valencia, which sealed Juventus's passage to the knock-out stages of the competition.[238] In December, he scored his tenth Serie A goal of the season, from the penalty spot, netting the final goal in a 3–0 away win over rivals Fiorentina; with this goal, Ronaldo became the first Juventus player since John Charles in 1957 to score 10 goals in his first 14 league games for the club.[239] After placing second in both the UEFA Men's Player of the Year and The Best FIFA Men's Player for the first time in three years, behind Luka Modrić, Ronaldo performances in 2018 also saw him voted runner-up for the 2018 Ballon d'Or, finishing once again behind his former Real Madrid teammate.</li><br>
